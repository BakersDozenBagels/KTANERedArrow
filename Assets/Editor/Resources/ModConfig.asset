  description: 'Ever wanted to solve a bomb, but you didn''t realize there was a boss,
    so you detonated? Now you don''t have to! All of your important modules will be
    identified in the least obstructive way possible, satisfaction guaranteed!


    This will identify bosses, semi-bosses, needies, pseudo-needies, and many other
    modules. No more memorizing thousands of modules!
